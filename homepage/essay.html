          <p id="para">My neighborhood is astounding. It is a miniature representation of New York City.
          To experience this mini representation of New York, you should go to Seaview Park. This is a place where everyone
          can go when they want to relax and have a good time. It is located on the edge of  Canarsie near the Pier. In the
          summer this place is packed to the gates with culture. Canarsie is jammed with people of different backgrounds. If
          you go there one day in the summer, you can experience the whole Caribbean in this one place. As you enter the park
          you will see that there is just a collaboration of cultures waiting for you.</p>
          <p id="para">As you walk through the grass areas of this park you see many different people from different places
          and ages expressing their culture and ethnicity. Jamaicans will blast their Reggae as the Haitians thirty feet to their
          right blast their Kompa. You’ll also smell all the delicious foods that people are grilling. The spices of the different
          types of poultry, seafood, and side dishes will overpower your nostrils and are enough to make your mouth water. Some of
          the foods include jerk chicken, baked fish, potato salad, mac and cheese and so many other foods. As you continue to walk
          you’ll also hear the wide range of languages spoken by all these people from Dutch to Haitian Creole to Spanish and so much
          more. The blending of all these cultures' foods, languages, and music is just so magnificent. It is so beautiful to be able
          to experience so many cultures at the same time. The park is held in shape by the people in it. They take care of the place
          where they can freely express their amazing cultural foods and music. There isn’t a lot of trash around as there are people
          to clean up the park. This is why Seaview is a place where I can look up to see a place that takes in my people and the things
          they stand for.</p>
          <p id="para">In such a large place there is so much for people to do. These different parts show how different people
          can live together without being able to relate to them. Different people from around the world play different games. Some
          people play basketball while others play soccer and so many other kinds of games. In Seaview Park, you can get introduced to
          so many different new games. You may like some and you may not want to play others a second time. But the most important thing
          is that you embraced a part of someone else’s culture even if you don’t like their game at the end of the day. At the end of the
          day, you may find a new game that you may add to your everyday life.</p>
          <p id="para">I can remember one of my earliest memories at Seaview Park when I had a church cookout there. A lot of my family and
          friends were there. At the time I was interested in playing soccer. There were lots of activities for everyone to partake in. I
          can distinctly remember there being a lot of different foods that members of my church had brought in. I can remember wanting to
          try all the foods to get a sense of the ways that different people eat. However, my stomach was only able to handle so much at
          the time so I eventually had to find something else to enjoy. Unfortunately,  no one at the cookout had brought any type of toy
          or ball for everyone to use. After a while of being bored I wanted to go home because there was nothing for me to do. Soon a
          stranger wandered over to us and asked us if we wanted to usehis ball. This person was a complete stranger who didn’t know any of
          us yet was willing to share his personal belongings with a group of kids. This random person made the cookout so much better
          because now we had another activity to partake in. After a while of playing soccer another one of my church members who I hadn’t
          really known had brought in a Frisbee which I had never seen before. He taught me how to use the Frisbee and was very kind while
          doing so. In exchange for the kindness of these kids, the adults of my church shared some of our food with these kids. Now as I
          am older I see that the whole experience showed me what Seaview Park stood for, inclusivity.</p>
          <p id="para">Seaview Park is a place where you can go and never feel like the odd one out. Similar to NYC, Seaview Park is very
          diverse and everyone is represented. This defines my NYC because when someone thinks of NYC, the first thing that comes to mind
          is how multicultural it is. </p>
